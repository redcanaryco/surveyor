using them and how.

Using
-----

Create and populate your cbapi credential file per the instructions found
here: https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi-python.

Run using one of the test definitions:

    ./surveyor.py --deffile definitions/file-transfer.json

Then open and review the default output file (survey.csv).

You can also run using an entire directory of definition files in one shot:

    ./surveyor.py --defdir definitions

If you're looking for instances of something specific and a Cb query suits you
best, you can do that too:

    ./surveyor.py --query 'process_name:explorer.exe username:joebob'
